## Description

Envoy WASM plugin to process X-Forwarded-For header. 
With it and a list of configured trusted networks, it gets real client IP, and put it in a custom header

## Motivation

Istio uses Envoy as proxy, and Envoy is quite amazing, but has some limitations. One of them is shown when running
behind a load-balancer that performs dynamic amount of hops before reaching Envoy. 

In that case, it's not possible to use 'xff_num_trusted_hops' parameter present in Envoy, as it needs a fixed amount
of trusted hops.

This plugin comes to fix this issue, being able to check the IPs coming into the `X-Forwarded-For` header, 
deleting those that are inside configured trusted networks, and finally writting client's real IP
in a custom header

That way, you can trust entire network ranges, instead of the number of hops, and get only the IPs that belongs to
foreign networks

## How to deploy

Deploying process for this plugin depends on the target (Istio or pure Envoy). You can find examples for both of them
in [documentation directory](./docs/samples). In fact, these examples are used by us to test, so you can rely on them.


## How to develop

This plugin is developed using Go, but compiled using TinyGo. This is done this way because of a limitation in the 
upstream compiler related to [exported functions when compiling to WebAssembly](https://github.com/tetratelabs/proxy-wasm-go-sdk/blob/main/doc/OVERVIEW.md#tinygo-vs-the-official-go-compiler). 

You don't have to worry about mentioned details, as it's only needed to craft your code and execute the following command:

```console
make build run
```

## How releases are created

Each release of this plugin is completely automated by using [Github Actions' workflows](./github). 
Inside those workflows, we use recipes present at Makefile as much as possible to be completely transparent 
in the process we follow for building this.

Assets belonging to each version can be found attached to the corresponding release. OCI images are not yet published
until the whole process is well tested.
